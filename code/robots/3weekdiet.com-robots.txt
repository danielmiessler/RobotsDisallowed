                        <em>You don’t know me but my name is Elisa and I bought The 3 Week Diet one month ago. I want to share my weight loss story with you, Brian. <br><br>Since having my first child, I've been carrying around an extra 30 pounds. I've tried many diets and couldn't make anything work. Your diet just made sense and showed me that everything I was doing was wrong and a waste of my time. <br><br>The 3 Week Diet plan was so refreshing and so simple to follow. I did everything you said and lost 23 pounds in first three weeks. I’m now starting the diet again from the start to lose the 7 pounds more. You have changed my life, and I am incredibly thankful. &nbsp;<img src="images/smile1.png">

                        I purchased your 3 Week Diet program before Christmas and started it on 21st January and it was a very informative and easily readable book. <BR><BR>I’ve lost 17 pounds in 12 days, I’m just concerned that I’m losing too much too quickly. I will admit I haven’t followed the guide exactly. I’m not sticking perfectly to the listed foods and meal plans (but mostly) and doing very little exercise, but the weight keeps flying off.
                        <br><br>
                        It clearly works and if I’d followed it exactly I think it would scare the living daylights out of me because of the amount that I’d lose  &nbsp;<img src="images/smile4.png">. So thanks again for the information. I’ve never purchased anything like this as they are usually full of trash, but 3WD has been a pleasant surprise.

                           <p><font color="#d2232a">The Introduction Manual</font> is more than just an introduction to the diet. Instead, it discusses the science behind how we gain and lose weight as well as <b>what absolutely needs to be done to attack that stubborn body fat</b> that, until now, has been so challenging to get rid of. <br><br>In addition to this, <font color="#d2232a">The Introduction Manual</font> will discuss the specific supplements recommended for this diet to be ultra-successful and the science behind those supplements and how they help you lose fat, increase metabolism and become much more healthy and energetic.</p>

                           <h4>Diet Manual</h4>
                           <p><font color="#d2232a">The Diet Manual</font> is where the “rubber meets the road.” Unlike those “one-size-fits-all” diets, <font color="#d2232a">The 3 Week Diet Manual</font> will show you how to calculate your lean body mass vs. fat percentage and will then <b>provide you with a specifically tailored rapid weight loss plan</b> to suit your body type. You’ll know exactly what to eat every day, how much to eat and when to eat it. You’ll never be guessing—just follow the outline and <b>you WILL lose weight.</b> <br><br>In addition to this, you'll discover the exact foods you must eat to maximize your body’s fat burning potential and what <b>foods you must avoid at all costs</b> because of their ability to slow down or even stop the fat burning process. </p>
                           <p><font color="#d2232a">The Diet Manual</font> is, quite frankly, the ultimate method for producing extremely fast fat loss results. And it doesn’t stop there. Also included in <font color="#d2232a">The Diet Manual</font> is my ultimate, super-simple plan for <b>keeping the weight you’ve lost OFF forever</b>, while still being able to enjoy your favorite foods. This allows you to live a “normal” life without worrying about the weight coming back <b>(you’ll love this!)</b>.</p>

                           <h4>Workout Manual</h4>
                           <p>While <font color="#d2232a">The Diet Manual</font> alone will produce truly amazing amounts of fat loss, <font color="#d2232a">The Workout Manual</font> can <b>help you to nearly double your results.</b> This was specifically designed for those who don’t have time to go to the gym every day—but it also includes a gym workout for those who do. And even if you don’t like to work out, I’ve developed an exercise program that provides “no excuses” because they take just 20 minutes a day, 3-4 days per week. <br><br>The simple fact is, exercising for fat burning is <b>not</b> about spending hours in the gym everyday. This is because fat loss is dependent on intensity—not time. Yes, it’s true you can lose weight spending an hour or so on the treadmill—but you’re never going to get rid of the stubborn body fat that way. The key to smashing fat-loss plateaus lies in short and intense, full body exercises that get every muscle in your body metabolically active.</p>
                           <p>When you add a quality workout program with <font color="#2359a0">The 3 Week Diet</font>, you truly have <b>the ultimate “knockout punch” for extremely fast fat loss.</b> <font color="#d2232a">The Workout Manual</font> also includes my ultimate <i>Midsection Miracle Workout</i>, which contains the only two abs exercises you will ever need if you desire a set of 6-pack abs. Many have said that this exercise alone is worth much more than the price of my system!</p>

                        <p>Now, I’m not going to insult your intelligence or risk my reputation by making some outlandish claims that in 21 days you’re going to have a set of 6-pack abs or be 50 pounds lighter than you are today without any effort...
                           <br><br>
                           <b>But what I am going to promise you is this:</b> <br>If you dedicate yourself over the next 21 days and follow <font color="#2359a0">The 3 Week Diet</font> as outlined, you will be walking around with <b>12 to 23 pounds of body fat gone</b> from your waist, hips, thighs, belly and butt. Your clothes will be looser, you’ll look healthier and more attractive…and you’ll have more energy than you’ve ever had in a long, long time.
                        </p>
