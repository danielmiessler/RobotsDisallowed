# Disallow for WebResource.axd caching issues. Several instances below to cover all search engines.

# To specify matching the end of a URL, use $

Disallow: /*.axd$
#
# However, WebResource.axd and ScriptResource.axd always include a query string parameter the URL does 
# not end with .axd thus, the correct robots.txt record for Google would be:
#
Disallow: /*.axd
#
# Not all crawlers recognize the wildcard '*' syntax. To comply with the robots.txt draft RFC
# Note that the records are case sensitive, and error page is showing the requests to be in lower case
# so let's include both cases below:
#
Disallow: /ScriptResource.axd
Disallow: /WebResource.axd
Disallow: /scriptresource.axd
