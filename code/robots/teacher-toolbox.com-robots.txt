    <p class="question">What is the Teacher Toolbox?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">The Teacher Toolbox provides immediate access to all grade levels of Ready&reg; instructional resources (grades K-8 in Reading/Math and grades 2-5 in Writing). Because the Toolbox is organized by standard, teachers can easily focus on particular skills that students may have not mastered. Since the Toolbox illustrates specific focus areas as well as strategies for both full classroom and small group instruction, it&rsquo;s the perfect solution for differentiating instruction.</p>

    <p class="section">Registration</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">I am a new customer. How do I register?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">Click &ldquo;Register Now&rdquo; at teacher-toolbox.com and follow the on-screen instructions. You should use your school email address and create a password. After completing the three short steps in registration, the system will send you an email with a link to click to activate your account. At that point, you&rsquo;ll be able to log in with your email address and password and will then be prompted to enter your license code.</p>
</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">If I have an i-Ready account, do I still need to register?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">Yes, the Toolbox and i-Ready are separate products, so your i-Ready credentials will not work for the Toolbox.</p>
</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">If I had an account last year, do I need to re-register so I can use my new code?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">No, you should log in with your email address and password, and you will be able to apply your new code to your existing account.</p>
</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="section">License Codes</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">How do I receive my codes?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">Check with your administrator to find out how your school purchased the Toolbox. If you are using the Toolbox in conjunction with the Ready print product, you should have been shipped Teacher Toolbox Access Packs, each with a unique code. If you bought the Toolbox to use with i-Ready, you should have received an e-mail with information on how to access the content.</p>
</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">My code is not working. What should I do?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">First, please make sure you have registered for the Toolbox and are logged in with your email address and password before you try to enter your code. As you enter your code, please make sure it appears the same as it does on your license code package (e.g., a zero has not been entered as an O). Also remember license codes are unique. Therefore, if someone has already redeemed that code, you may contact your administrator to see if they have additional codes or <a href="mailto:toolboxsupport@cainc.com">toolboxsupport@cainc.com</a> for more information.</p>

    <p class="section">Content</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">Why can&#039;t I access all the subjects?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">Reading, Writing and Math licenses are sold separately, so please be sure that your school or district has ordered the subjects you are looking for. If you aren&rsquo;t able to access an additional subject, please contact Customer Service at 800-225-0248 or toolboxsupport@cainc.com.</p>

    <p class="question">Where can I access the correlations and other resources found in the front matter of my Teacher Resource Book?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">Click on Program Implementation at the top left of the page to see correlations and other resources found in the front of your Teacher Resource Book.</p>
</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">Where are the Ready Assessments and Assessment Teacher Guides on the Teacher Toolbox?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">Click on Ready Assessment Book to see the Ready Assessments and Teacher Guides.</p>
</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">Why are there two of each lesson at grades 2–5 in math and reading?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">In math and reading at grades 2&ndash;5, Toolbox users have access to the 2014 and 2016 copyright of the Ready books. If you have print books, you may prefer to use the version that matches your books.</p>
</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">Why are some of the Interactive Tutorials missing?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">In some cases, there are no Interactive Tutorials to support a particular Ready lesson. We are always working to boost our coverage of the standards, and we plan to include more Interactive Tutorials in the future.</p>
</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">Why do some of the Interactive Tutorials seem to be different than the Ready lesson they accompany?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">Some Interactive Tutorials have different titles than the Ready lessons, often because they teach the same standards and skills in different ways or through slightly different content. Some tutorials are also designated as prerequisites and are intended to teach prerequisite skills to the standard in question. In these cases, the titles may not match at all.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.25in">Additionally, some Interactive Tutorials are correlated with more than one Ready lesson. The intent is to show that these tutorials can support the teaching of more than one Ready skill.</p>
</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">Is this a student subscription?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">No, the Toolbox is a teacher resource designed to provide teachers access to the Ready lessons and additional resources, which can be used for whole class or small groups to help differentiate instruction. Lessons are conveniently organized to match your print materials, making it easy to find additional resources for teaching the skills and standards associated with each lesson. All of these resources are perfect for use with any interactive whiteboard or other computer projection screen.</p>

    <p class="section">System Requirements and Permissions</p>
</li>  <li>
    <p class="question">What are the system requirements for the Toolbox?</p>
    <p class="answer"><p style="margin-left:.25in">System requirements for the Toolbox are the same as for our other online product, i-Ready Diagnostic &amp; Instruction. These requirements can be found online at <a href="http://www.i-ready.com/support/i-ReadySystemRequirements.pdf">http://www.i-ready.com/support/i-ReadySystemRequirements.pdf</a>.</p>
