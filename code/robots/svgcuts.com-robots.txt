# If you wish to prevent indexing of your /images folder, add a line that says:
#   Disallow: /images
# (but remove the # from the beginning of the line! )
#
# And if you wish your popup pages to not be indexed, you can add this also:
#   Disallow: /index.php?main_page=popup_image*
# (again, remove the # )
#
# Do not list any private folders here ... otherwise their existence is no longer private.

# Your robots.txt file should go in your /public_html or /httpdocs folder,
# (even if your Zen Cart installation might be in a subfolder). Adjust any folder paths accordingly.
