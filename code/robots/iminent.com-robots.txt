    </strong></span>
  </p><br>
  <p>
    <span style="color: #000000;"><strong>
      <span lang="EN-US">THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION UNLESS YOU AND IMINENT S.A. ("IMINENT" OR "WE") HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE AGREEMENT GOVERNING USE OF THE APPLICATION.</span></strong></span></p><br>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-US">Iminent Minibar is IMINENT S.A. proprietary software that facilitates creation and usage of content such as emoticons, winks and fire nudges that can be used in online communications through services including but not limited to AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, Google Talk, AOL Mail, Gmail and Yahoo! Mail.  SearchTheWeb (or StartWeb) is an IMINENT S.A. search feature that allows users to search the internet through IMINENT's search properties.  The IMINENT TOOLBAR is IMINENT S.A. proprietary software that provides an internet browser toolbar that allows users to access features including but not limited to games, winks, emoticons, mood avatars, favorite websites, popup blockers and email notifications.</span></p><br>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-US">IMINENT S.A. is willing to license the Application to you only upon the condition that you accept all the terms contained in this Agreement.  By clicking on the "I accept" button below or by downloading, installing or using the Application, you have indicated that you understand this Agreement and accept all of its terms.</span></p><br>
  <h2 style="margin: auto 0cm;">
    <span lang="EN-US">
      <span style="font-size: 16px;">1.  Grant of License.</span></span></h2><br>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-US">Conditioned upon your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, IMINENT S.A. grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license for a single user to use the executable form of the Application on a single computer owned or controlled by you, solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes, as described herein.  IMINENT S.A. reserves all rights in the Application not expressly granted to you in this Agreement. </span></p>
  <h2 style="margin: auto 0cm;">
    <span lang="EN-US">
      <span style="font-size: 16px;">2. Services.</span></span></h2><br>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-US">When you download, install or use any component of the Application to access and use various components thereof, including Iminent Minibar, SearchTheWeb (or StartWeb) and the IMINENT TOOLBAR, you acknowledge and agree that the IMINENT homepage, accessible at search.iminent.com or start.iminent.com, will be your default internet browser homepage as a result of such action. You may specify during installation of the Application that you do not accept the IMINENT homepage as your default homepage, and this default feature will be deactivated.  You may also deactivate this default feature.</span></p><br>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-US">Other IMINENT software features, i.e. Iminent Minibar, SearchTheWeb (or StartWeb) and the IMINENT TOOLBAR will be set as default features when you install the Application. The SearchTheWeb  (or StartWeb) feature will install automatically during the installation process, but during installation, you may choose to deactivate the SearchTheWeb (or StartWeb) installation.  Once SearchTheWeb (or StartWeb) has been deactivated, IMINENT will not reactivate SearchTheWeb (or StartWeb), unless you download new content from IMINENT which contains the SearchTheWeb (or StartWeb) feature; you will be notified during such download of new content that the SearchTheWeb (or StartWeb) feature will be activated upon download.</span></p><br>
  <p>
      <span lang="EN-US">If you have installed the IMINENT TOOLBAR, a pop-up window will inform you when the installation of software (such as another toolbar, plug-ins, add-ons, etc.) may interfere with or alter the functioning of the IMINENT TOOLBAR. The IMINENT TOOLBAR does not prevent the installation of such software. If you wish to continue using the IMINENT TOOLBAR with all its functionalities, it is your responsibility not to install such software.</span></p><br>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-US">We reserve the right to add additional features or functions to the existing Application or components thereof. When installed on your computer, the Application periodically communicates with our servers. We may require the updating of the Application on your computer when we release a new version of the Application, or when we make new features available. This update may occur automatically or upon prior notice to you and may occur all at once or over multiple sessions. On some browsers, IMINENT may modify the account sync settings in order to function properly. You understand that we may require your review and acceptance of our then-current End User License Agreement before you will be permitted to use any subsequent versions of the Application. You acknowledge and agree that we have no obligation to make available to you any subsequent versions of the Application.  You are not obligated to use any of the features of the Application, including, but not limited to emoticons and video features.</span></p><br>
  <p>
    <span lang="EN-US">IMINENT may serve advertisements to you as part of your use of the Application. The display of such advertisements is justified by the free license on the Application that is granted to you. While using the Application, you agree that the display of such advertisements is likely to modify the web pages you are browsing. In that respect the application will not modify the layout of such web pages but solely add advertisements on those pages in the form of banners or totems, depending on the concerned web pages. If ever you consider any advertisement as uninteresting, irrelevant, against your opinion, repetitive or if you simply wish to get rid of it, you are free to suspend the display of such advertisement by clicking the IMINENT logo within the Iminent Minibar or IMINENT TOOLBAR. If you do not want to receive such advertisements, you may change your settings after installation of the Application to deactivate the serving of advertisements to you. We draw your attention to the fact that these advertisements are not associated with or endorsed by the websites on which they are displayed. IMINENT may modify your default search provider during your use of the Application.  If you do not want to have your default search provider modified, you may refuse the modification as part of the Application installation process. IMINENT may also redirect your Web Browser's about:blank and new tabs functionality to the IMINENT search page during your use of the Application.</span></p><br>
